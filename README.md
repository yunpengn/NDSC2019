# National Data Science Challenge 2019

This repository presents our approach to the problem in the [National Data Science Challenge 2019](https://careers.shopee.sg/ndsc/), organized by [Shopee](https://shopee.com/). We are a team of 4 undergraduate students from the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/), comprising of

## Problem Description

There are hundreds of thousands new products added to Shopee every day. To make relevant products easily discoverable, one fundamental challenge is to accurately extract relevant information from a large volume of products. In NDSC 2019, this real-world challenge of building an automatic solution to extract product related information through machine learning techniques is presented.

For the beginner category, we would focus on **Product Category Classification**. Participants are required to determine the category of a product given its image and title. Performance will be evaluated based on the accuracy of the classification results. More information can be found at the Kaggle competition page at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ndsc-beginner).
